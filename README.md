# LetsGo
I will be uploading here all my projects written in Go (or golang) in an attempt to showcase my self-learning of the language and hopefully help other fellow students

## Projects available

### [Massive Cheat Sheet](./Massive_Cheatsheet/massiveCheatSheet.go)
#### What is it
It is a transcription of the 7 hours video from freeCodeCamp.org [Learn Go Programming - Golang Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU)
It contains all the snippets of code used to demonstrate what Go can do for you and some comments from myself to help you read the cheat sheet.

#### How to use
You will find 15 different topics spread over 19 functions in the main function (lines 19 - 39)

You can either: 
Comment out the specific topic you want to test in the main function and then play around with the snippets in their corresponding lines, or
Grab the snippets and paste them into your scripts. If you are going to be watching the video, it may come in handy to copy-paste only the text shown on the screen into your IDE so you can try the same things Mike does in the video.

### [Go Port Scanner](./Go_Port_Scanner/goPortScanner.go)
#### What is it
It is a simple Port Scanner written in Go to practice pointers, dereferencing and concurrency.

#### How to use
